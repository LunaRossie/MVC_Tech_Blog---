## Description

I've created a Blog to enhance lesson learned throughout the course to practice and show off an application that contained within CMS-style blog. Developers can publish their posts and comments on opther developer's posts as well. The app contains the MVC paradigm using handlebars.js, sequelize as the ORM, and authentication package using express sessions.

## Instruction

The user must create a basic repository including gitignore "node_modules" and license "MIT" from Github. Clone the repo, navigate to the root folder, and conduct testings such as; npm run test, npm start server, and npm run seed.
